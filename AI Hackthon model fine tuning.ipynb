      "Input: Herein, we propose an innovative approach to mitigate this problem: Modular Construction. This method embraces recycling and reuse, taking a significant stride towards a circular economy.   Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled on-site. These components are designed for easy disassembling, enabling them to be reused in diverse projects, thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources.  Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90%, but it also decreases construction time by 30-50%, optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency. This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses. Moreover, the modular approach allows greater flexibility, adapting to changing needs over time.  We believe, by adopting modular construction, the industry can transit from a 'take, make and dispose' model to a more sustainable 'reduce, reuse, and recycle' model, driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future. The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe, indicating its potential for scalability and real-world application.\n",

      "Example 2:\n",
      "Input: The proposed solution is a garment rental service. Such a service should work closely with major clothing brands. When buying items, customers should have the option to buy or rent. This model would be like a subscription service where customers can select a set number of items each month, wear them, then return them for other items. Clothing would be professionally cleaned between customers and repaired as necessary to maximize its life cycle. When a garment is no longer suitable for rental, it can be recycled into new clothes. This solution reduces the number of garments produced, the amount of transportation needed, and the quantity of clothes going to landfills. Completely damaged or unusable textiles can be reused or recycled into new products. It also gives financial value to businesses as it transforms fashion from a single-purchase model into a subscription service, creating a continuous income stream. Its feasibility and scalability depend on factors such as location, culture, and income level. However, as digital platforms become more common for commerce, this concept could be globally implemented.\n",

Besides reducing waste and pollution associated with production and disposal, such a platform would provide unprecedented variety in virtual wardrobes, thereby catering to the consumer desire for constantly changing styles.  Users could pay a subscription fee to access a vast virtual fashion library, thus generating steady revenue for businesses. The AR technology can be continuously updated and scaled up, enabling expansion into new markets and styles. While upfront investment in technology development and updates may be significant, this will be offset by reduced production costs and increased customer reach. The environmental impact would be vastly reduced as clothing production would drop dramatically, effectively addressing one of the world's largest polluting industries.

Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled on-site. These components are designed for easy disassembling, enabling them to be reused in diverse projects, thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources.  Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90%, but it also decreases construction time by 30-50%, optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency. This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses. Moreover, the modular approach allows greater flexibility, adapting to changing needs over time.  We believe, by adopting modular construction, the industry can transit from a 'take, make and dispose' model to a more sustainable 'reduce, reuse, and recycle' model, driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future. The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe, indicating its potential for scalability and real-world application.\n",

      "Example 2:\n",
      "Input: The proposed solution is a garment rental service. Such a service should work closely with major clothing brands. When buying items, customers should have the option to buy or rent. This model would be like a subscription service where customers can select a set number of items each month, wear them, then return them for other items. Clothing would be professionally cleaned between customers and repaired as necessary to maximize its life cycle. When a garment is no longer suitable for rental, it can be recycled into new clothes. This solution reduces the number of garments produced, the amount of transportation needed, and the quantity of clothes going to landfills. Completely damaged or unusable textiles can be reused or recycled into new products. It also gives financial value to businesses as it transforms fashion from a single-purchase model into a subscription service, creating a continuous income stream. Its feasibility and scalability depend on factors such as location, culture, and income level. However, as digital platforms become more common for commerce, this concept could be globally implemented.\n",

      "Input: I propose an innovative digital platform that uses Augmented Reality (AR) technology for consumers to \"\"try on\"\" and virtually own clothing items. This would permit customers to experience wearing various fashion items without the need for physical ownership. Besides reducing waste and pollution associated with production and disposal, such a platform would provide unprecedented variety in virtual wardrobes, thereby catering to the consumer desire for constantly changing styles.  Users could pay a subscription fee to access a vast virtual fashion library, thus generating steady revenue for businesses. The AR technology can be continuously updated and scaled up, enabling expansion into new markets and styles. While upfront investment in technology development and updates may be significant, this will be offset by reduced production costs and increased customer reach. The environmental impact would be vastly reduced as clothing production would drop dramatically, effectively addressing one of the world's largest polluting industries. The novelty lies in the use of AR technology in this field, which still is a largely untapped area. This integrates technology with sustainable fashion practices, creating value for consumers, businesses, and most importantly, our planet.\n",
